[[swagger_operationId]]
=== OpenAPI operationId

OpenApi2Markup uniquely identify each operations for multiple purposes :

  * generating separated operation files : file name
  * generating unique Markup anchors for operations and all sub-items.
  * searching for extra content for operations : operation folder name for content plugins (Hand-written descriptions, Dynamic content, etc...)
  * ...

OpenAPI specification supports the `operationId` field which create an unique name for each operation.
When provided, this `operationId` value will be used primarily. Otherwise OpenApi2Markup generates an id using `normalize(operation.summary + " " + lowerCase(operation.HTTPmethod))`.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to set an operationId for each operation, so that a lot of actions does not depend on operation `summary` which *can change at anytime*.
  
=== OpenAPI schema title

OpenApi2Markup displays inline schemas by decomposing them (when schema is complex). In this process, some intermediate references are generated using field names which is not always the best choice.
The OpenAPI document supports JSON Schema `title` items in inline schemas.
It's recommended to use them in inline schemas so that they'll be used primarily to field names and this will lead to a better naming.
