== Overview


NOTE: Dear community,
unfortunately I can't maintain OpenApi2Markup alone anymore. There are many interesting new topics:
1) OpenAPI v3 support
2) Fixing bugs
2) Merge OpenApi2Markup repositories and create a new multi-module repository.
Any help is welcome.
Kind regards,
Robert


The primary goal of this project is to *simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that's been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation* produced by https://github.com/swagger-api[OpenAPI]. The result is intended to be an *up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide*, comparable to https://developer.github.com/v3/[GitHub's API documentation]. The output of OpenApi2Markup can be used as an alternative to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[swagger-ui] and can be served as static content.
NOTE: The OpenAPI Specification has been donated to to the https://openapis.org/[Open API Initiative (OAI)] and has been renamed to the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI Specification].

OpenApi2Markup converts a OpenAPI JSON or YAML file into several *AsciiDoc* or *GitHub Flavored Markdown* documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The OpenAPI source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. OpenApi2Markup supports the OpenAPI 1.2 and 2.0 specification. Internally it uses the _official_ https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser[swagger-parser] and my https://github.com/RobWin/markup-document-builder[markup-document-builder].

You can use OpenApi2Markup to convert your contract-first OpenAPI YAML file into a human-readable format and combine it with hand-written documentation. As an alternative, you can choose the code-first approach and use OpenApi2Markup together with https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/OpenAPI-Core-JAX-RS-Project-Setup-1.5.X[OpenAPI JAX-RS], https://github.com/springfox/springfox[springfox] or https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[spring-restdocs]. If you are Gradle or Maven user, you can also use the https://github.com/RobWin/swagger2markup-gradle-plugin[OpenApi2Markup Gradle Plugin] or https://github.com/redowl/swagger2markup-maven-plugin[OpenApi2markup Maven Plugin].

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] is preferable to Markdown as it has more features. AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be converted to *HTML*, *PDF* and *EPUB*. AsciiDoc is much better suited for describing public APIs than *JavaDoc* or *Annotations*.

You can generate your HTML5, PDF and EPUB documentation via https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[asciidoctorj] or even better via the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin] or https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin].

The project requires at least JDK 8.
